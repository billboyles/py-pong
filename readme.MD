# Fonts

This game uses two fonts that are not included in the download: the TrueType Font `Alien-Encounters-Regular.ttf` from [DaFont](https://www.dafont.com/alien-encounters.font) and `Courier New`. 

Although the `Alien-Encounters-Regular` font is marked as free for personal use, I have not included it due to being unsure if the author considers distributing an allowed use. To use this font, download it from DaFont and make sure the `.ttf` file is in the main game directory. The game searches for the `Courier New` font installed as a system font. If either font is not found, the game defaults to an included font.
